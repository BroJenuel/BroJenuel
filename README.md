<summary> 👔 About Me</summary>

My name is Jenuel Ganawed. I’m a developer with a full-stack background and a keen eye for good design. I love to make complex things simple and joy to use. Currently, I focus on building web apps with VueJs(v2)(v3) and Laravel.

Over the past 5 years, I’ve gained experience across some aspects of the application lifecycle, including frontend, backend, and dev-ops. It allows me to take full ownership of a project from design to implementation and deployment.
